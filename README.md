### About
This is a set of small shell scripts used to simplify common tasks, like keeping
Homebrew (Mac only), Python & Python Installed Packages (PIP), Perl & Ruby
up-to-date, decoding Amazon Kinesis data blocks and verifying the integrity of
downloaded files.

Instructions for each script are at the top of the file.  Simply run each script
without arguments - if arguments are required, a usage string will be printed to
the console.
