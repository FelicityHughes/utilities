### About
This is a set of small shell scripts used to simplify common tasks, like keeping
Homebrew up-to-date (Mac only), keeping Ruby up-to-date, decoding Amazon Kinesis
data blocks and verifying the integrity of downloaded files.

Instructions for each script are at the top of the file.  Simply run each script
without arguments - if arguments are required, a usage string will be printed to
the console.
